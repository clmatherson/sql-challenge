The employee information provided on Pewlett Hackard was from the 1980's and 1990's.
A review of salaries has determined the information provided may not be accurate.

Observations:
Senior Engineers are paid the least. This is unusual. Senior Engineers are usually
the most skilled and the most experienced which means they would have a higher compensation
than other titles of Engineers.
In the Engineer class, Assistant Engineers have the highest average salary. We would expect
the opposite to be true since they are usually less skilled and less experienced.
Staff salaries are higher than both Managers and Technique Leaders which would be unusual.

    Title            Avg Salary
Senior Staff          58,550
Staff                 58,465
Manager               51,531
Technique Leader      48,583
Assistant Engineer    48,564
Engineer              48,535
Senior Engineer       48,507

Also, after running several queries on the data, one item that seem highly unusual was
255 employees ( including 110 female employees) with the first name of "Hercules".
Although this would not be impossible, it is suspect.
